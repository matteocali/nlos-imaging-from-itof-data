# Non-Line-of-Sight imaging from indirect Time of Flight data

This repository contains all the code and tools related to the work pressented in the paper [Non-Line-of-Sight Imaging from indirect Time of Flight data](https://arxiv.org).

The repository is organized in three sub folder:

1. [additional_scripts](./additional_scripts/): contains all the code to genrate and pre-proces the presented synthetic dataset;
2. [itofNet_code](./itofNet_code/): contains the code of the proposed network;
3. [tools](./tools/): contains all the additional data and tools used in the previous two sections.

To download the dataset please use the following links:

* synthetic dataset available [here](https://medialab.dei.unipd.it/paper_data/NLoS_iToF_data/synthetic_data/fixed_camera_full.zip),
* splits used in the paper are available [here](https://medialab.dei.unipd.it/paper_data/NLoS_iToF_data/synthetic_data/fixed_camera_full_splits.zip).

## How to run the code

In order to run the proposed code follow the instruction presented in the [additional_scripts](./additional_scripts/README.md) and [itofNet_code](./itofNet_code/README.md) README.
